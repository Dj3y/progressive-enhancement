                    or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there,
                    it's just not serious, and there's no such thing as an issue.</p>
                <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if
                    the brain doesn't think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses don't transmit
                    the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. That's
                    possible because our perception is limited : you can't see at 360 degrees for
                    example. If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in
                    a way, our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change
                    reality that much, everything's fake.</p>
                <p>
                    They're proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you'll see that person as
                    divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid
                    ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you
                    just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it's not just that you can
                    make your world, it's that you passively do it anyway.

                    whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
                    commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                    is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Is it
                    <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
                    <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.” The next day the horse came
                    back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in thebevening everybody came back
                    and said, “Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
                    horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it
                    <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
                    <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”
                </p>
                <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding
                    it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that's
                    too
                    <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,” and the farmer responded, “Is it
                    <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
                    <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.” The next day the army, and they
                    rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all theneighbors came around
                    and said, “Isn't that great!” Again, he said, “Is it
                    <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
                    <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”

                <blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
                    complexity, and it's really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in

                    <strong class="good">good</strong>

                    <strong class="bad">bad</strong>
                    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you
